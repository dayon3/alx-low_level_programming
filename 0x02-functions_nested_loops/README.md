# C - Functions, nested loops

`0-putchar.c` - A program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.
- The program should return `0`

`1-alphabet.c` - A function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void print_alphabet(void);`
- You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code

`2-print_alphabet_x10.c` - A function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void print_alphabet_x10(void);`
- You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code
